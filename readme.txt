Automaticly builds a Table of Contents once specific number (eg. 3) of headings (h1-h6) is reached and inserts it before or after post/page content.

== Description ==

This plugin is meant to help with navigation in long texts by forming an automatic Wikipedia-like table of contents. 

It works by scannig the text for headings (`<h1>-<h6>` HTML tags). If more than a certain amount of headings (3 by default) are found - a table of contents with bookmarks is formed and inserted to the post content. Location (above or below) the text can be chosen in settings page.

TOC is formed as HTML5 `<nav>` element with nested ordered list inside. No specific styling is provided, so that it fits organicaly into the text. If you need specific styling, include it to your theme's CSS.
