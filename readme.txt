Automaticly builds a Table of Contents once specific number (eg. 3) of headings (h1-h6) is reached and inserts it before or after post/page content.

== Description ==

This plugin is meant to help with navigation in long texts by forming an automatic Wikipedia-like table of contents.

It works by scanning the text for headings (`<h1>-<h6>` HTML tags). If more than a certain amount of headings (3 by default) are found - a table of contents with bookmarks is formed and inserted to the post content. Location (above or below) the text can be chosen in settings page.

TOC is formed as HTML5 `<nav>` element with nested ordered list inside. No specific styling is provided, so that it fits organicaly into the text. If you need specific styling, include it to your theme's CSS.

You can also use a shortcode - [toc], template tags - get_toc()/the_toc() and a widget - tinyTOC Widget.
